# The weightings that will be applied to the tenants, doesn't need to add up to

# the same order as the tenants listed above, i.e.:
#
#   one   => 60 / 100 weighting
#   two   => 25 / 100 weighting
#   three => 10 / 100 weighting
#   four  =>  5 / 100 weighting
# 
# If there are too few weightings, the missing weights will be set to 1, if 
# there are too many weightings, the extra weightings will be ignored.

# NOTE: This property is only used if the strategy listed above is NAMED
#
# The names that will be applied to the tenants.  Each of the names allow the 
# tenants to be grouped into a sub-pool, to utilise the pool, a call to 
# getConnection(String poolName), NOT just getConnection().  If a call to 
# getConnection() is used, then it will return a random connection.  Within each
# sub-pool, the connection that is retrieved is randonmly assigned.
#
# These __MUST__ be in the same order as the tenants listed above, i.e.:
#
#   one   => read
#   two   => read
#   three => read
#   four  => write
# 
# If there are too few names, the missing names will not be added to any pool 
# and will not be accessible.  If there are too many names, the extra names will
# be ignored.
